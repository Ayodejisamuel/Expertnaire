      <strong>Re:</strong>Expertnaire is an online marketplace for the sale of
      high value digital products. On Expertnaire, there are 3 parties - The
      vendor, the affiliate and the customer
    </p>

    <p class="text-gray-800 mt-4 md:text-lg mx-auto">
      The vendor refers to the person who owns the product that is been sold
    </p>

    <p class="text-gray-800 mt-4 md:text-lg mx-auto">
      Affiliates are marketers who recommend the products on the platform to
      people and when any of the person they refer buys, they get a commission
    </p>

    <p class="text-gray-800 mt-4 mb-10 md:text-lg mx-auto">
      Customers are simply those who purchase the products been sold on

      <strong>Re:</strong>Expertnaire only accepts vendors with very valuable
      products. To sign up as a Vendor on Expertnaire, you need to send an email
      to help@expertnaire.com providing the details of your products and access
      to the product itself.
    </p>

    <p class="text-gray-800 mt-4 mb-10 md:text-lg mx-auto">
